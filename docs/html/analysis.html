      <h2>Time Complexity Analysis:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The <strong>isMatching</strong> function has a time complexity of O(1)
          since it performs constant-time operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>optimalMatching</strong> function has a time complexity of
          O(n^3), where n is the length of the input RNA sequence. It uses
          nested loops with a maximum difference of
          <strong>diff &lt; n</strong> to fill the dynamic programming (DP)
          table. Inside the innermost loop, it iterates over potential matching
          pairs, which can take O(n) time in the worst case.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>traceback</strong> function has a time complexity of
          O(n^2) in the worst case. It recursively explores the DP table to
          reconstruct the optimal secondary structure. In the worst case, when
          all base pairs are nested, the recursion depth can reach O(n), and
          within each recursive call, it iterates over potential matching pairs,
          which can take O(n) time.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>oneDViz</strong> and
          <strong>pythonCSIndex</strong> functions have a time complexity of
          O(n), as they iterate over the RNA sequence and the pairs once.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="para">
        Overall, the time complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the
        <strong>optimalMatching</strong> function, which has a time complexity
        of O(n^3).
      </p>

      <h2>Issues with the algorithm:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The algorithm makes use of several hard restrictions such as the sharp
          turn condition- which states: between 2 bonded nucleotides, there must
          be atleast 4 nucleotides. This restriction is a good approximation for
          smaller RNA sequences, but fails for large chains.
        </li>
        <li>
          In this algorithm, we try to maximize the A-U, G-C pairings. But
          normally the secondary structure predictions also consider the energy
          minimization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Base pair maximization does not yield biologically relevant
          structures: i.no stacking of base pairs considered ii.loop size not
          distingushed iii.no special scoring of multiple loops
        </li>
        <li>
          Through this algorithm, given a sequence, only 1 structure is
          predicted: i. base pair maximization can not differnciate structures
          sufficiently well: possibly many optima ii.no sub-optimal solutions
        </li>
        <li>Crossing structures cannot be predicted</li>
      </ul>
